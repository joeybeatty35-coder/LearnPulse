        <p>
          This week I spent hours in the lab (website) writing, brainstorming. looking over videos, articles and also I admit watching YouTube videos tik tok videos but not to entertain myself but for people's testimonials on the state of society. what troubles us ? What keeps us up at night ? What am I doing with my life ? Why am I not losing weight? Why am I stressed out ? The list goes on and on and of course on .
        </p>

        <p>
          I wondered why people not all people mind you, have worries, self doubts, addiction comforts like alcohol, food, drugs, money concerns . lack of family time significant other issues. it's the sign of the times well then again nothing is new under the sun human behavior patterns repeated since the caveman days .the things, situations, people deal with on a daily basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ok, I know maybe nobody would read this but if by some luck were to happen to come along like a bitter taste of medicine but the end result is getting better I'm all for it . If this reaches at least one person and they identify with this that's good in my perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
          I went all in I wrote a self help book. yes I'm aware who am I? and and why bother to write a self help book right ? Well to be honest I meant it to be for me personally.
        </p>

        <p>
          The notes I jotted down over time at first, it was meant to be for me my method to sort out the chaos of overconsumption of media videos, articles, to drown out the noise of being constantly hit with stuff I didn't know or was aware of existed etc. what a time to live in the digital age right ?
        </p>

        <p>
          So basically I jammed all the notes writings of things I came across that stuck out to me the things I wanted to learn about and I complied it into one book. A playbook for me but then I thought would be great to help others as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I did the run around maybe others would learn with me but in their comfort zone reading it at home or on the road traveling to kill time might as well learn right ?
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason I charge for the book, I did the work. long hours writing down watching being selective on what I worried abouty concerns and how to overcome them .the time spent trying to figure out how can I accomplish this my thoughts ran 100 miles a hour.
        </p>

        <p>
          I gotta say I exhausted myself thru trial and error but I got it done. If you want you can too if that's what you want or any other dream or skills knowledge just gotta apply yourself energy effort effective system of thought but my opinion avoid the self doubt you got this until then enjoy your morning, evening, night wherever you may be in the world much love and respect my friends.
